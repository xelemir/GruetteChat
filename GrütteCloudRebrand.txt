Exciting Update: GrütteChat Joins GrütteCloud!

In the upcoming weeks, we have some exciting changes lined up for our platform. We are thrilled to introduce GrütteCloud, which will incorporate GrütteChat as one of its sub-products. As part of this expansion, we are also introducing a brand-new service called GrütteStorage—a versatile cloud file storage and sharing service—that you can explore right away. Please note that GrütteStorage is exclusively available to GrütteCloud PLUS customers.

Additionally, we want to inform you that GrütteChat PLUS will be rebranded as GrütteCloud PLUS. Rest assured, all the fantastic features you enjoy with GrütteChat PLUS will remain intact, and we have even more exciting features in store for you.

To streamline your experience, we will rebrand your existing GrütteChat login credentials as GrütteID. This unified GrütteID will grant you access to all GrütteCloud products effortlessly. The best part is, you won't need to take any action on your end. We will handle all the necessary changes behind the scenes.

We are excited to embark on this journey with you and assure you that these updates will enhance your overall platform experience. Stay tuned for even more exciting features and improvements coming your way. Thank you for being a valued part of our community!
